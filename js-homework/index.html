      The Volkswagen Golf Mk7 (also known as the Golf VII[4]) is a compact car, the seventh generation of the Volkswagen Golf and the successor to the Volkswagen Golf Mk6. It was announced in Berlin on 4 September 2012, before a public launch at the 2012 Paris Auto Show.[5] Cars reached Volkswagen dealers in the Golf's European domestic market on 10 November 2012.[6]</p>
      <p>The Golf Mk7 uses the same MQB platform as the third-generation Audi A3, SEAT León and Škoda Octavia. At its introduction in 2013, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award, the first time it was awarded to a European product.</p>
      <p>On 10 November 2016, VW presented a facelift of the Golf Mk7.[7]</p>

Engine options at launch include 1.2 and 1.4 litre turbocharged petrol engines, with 85 PS (63 kW; 84 hp) and 140 PS (103 kW; 138 hp) respectively, and 1.6 and 2.0 litre diesel engines, with 105 PS (77 kW; 104 hp) and 150 PS (110 kW; 148 hp) respectively.[9] The 1.6 TDI BlueMotion Concept has a theoretical combined fuel consumption of 3.2 l/100 km (88 mpg‑imp; 74 mpg‑US) and anticipated 85 g/km CO2 emissions.</p>

<p>Available body styles are three and five door hatchbacks (including high-performance Golf GTI and Golf R models), a five-door estate (known as the Sportwagen in the United States, first advertised in May 2015), and a five-door Golf SV (which replaces the Golf Plus)</p>

<p>At launch in the US market, Volkswagen also offered the Golf Sport model. About 650 of these SE four-door models were built, equipped with the six-speed automatic transmission. Offered in either Pure White or Platinum Gray, the Sport model is visually enhanced with a striking bodykit that includes a front lip spoiler, side skirts, a rear valence, a larger rear spoiler, and chrome exhaust tips. </p>

<p>Variants to be introduced later include a five-door Golf CC liftback, and two-door cabriolet. The Golf went on sale in the UK in early January and was released in Australia in April 2013.</p>

<p>In Brazil, the Golf Mk7 went on sale in September 2013, only in the Highline and GTI trims,[15] along with the Comfortline trim,[16] which was made available from March 2014. All models were imported from Germany.</p>

<p>VW confirmed that models from August 2014 on will be imported from Mexico, from the VW Puebla factory. As of 2015, the VW Golf MK7 and Estate MK7 is made in Puebla, Mexico. However, starting in 2019, all new Golfs will be made in the Wolfsburg plant.</p>

        <h4>Engines</h4>
<p>The Golf line is available in all the relevant drive systems: the Golf TSI, including GTI, is petrol-powered; Golf TDI, including GTD, is diesel-powered; the Golf TGI is powered by compressed natural gas (CNG); the e-Golf is powered by electricity; and Golf GTE is a plug-in hybrid. The use of a modular transverse matrix assembly kit enables the manufacturing of Golf models with gasoline, diesel, natural gas, electric and hybrid drives from bumper to bumper at Volkswagen factories.[18] Retail deliveries of the e-Golf in Germany are scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2014.[19] U.S. sales are slated to start on selected markets during the fourth quarter of 2014.[20] The Golf GTE will be launched also in the fourth quarter of 2014.[18]</p>
